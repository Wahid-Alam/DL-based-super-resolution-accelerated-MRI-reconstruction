# Deep learning based super resolution accelerated MRI reconstruction
### project description:
in this class project, we are to show super-resolution implementation to help MRI reconstruction using both supervised and unsupervised learning. In phase 1, we apply model-based residual CNN MRI reconstruction framework followed by [SRResNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1501.00092) upscaling block in a supervised fashion. Next, we include additonal perceptual loss from a feature mapping network with the existing pixelwise loss term to recover the photo-realistic textures from heavily under-sampled MRi acquisitions. The feature mapping network is trained with patches from the training samples contaminated with dofferent level of noise representations.
